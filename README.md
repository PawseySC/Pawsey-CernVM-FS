# Pawsey-CernVM-FS

"The CernVM File System (CernVM-FS) is a read-only file system designed to deliver scientific software onto virtual machines and physical worker nodes in a fast, scalable, and reliable way. Files and file metadata are downloaded on demand and aggressively cached." - [CernVM-FS](https://cvmfs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/cpt-overview.html)

CernVM-FS is a useful solution for ensuring access to commonly used datasets is centralised and easy, and the datasets always updated on the main repository server (Stratum 0), mirrored by replica web servers (Stratum 1), fetched by the proxies (Stratum 2), and accessible to the clients (Stratum 3).

Users will simply access the data sets as though part of their file system, e.g. accessing the Galaxy project's data repository web server (Stratum 1) is as simple as this:

    ls /cvmfs/data.galaxyproject.org

Once the above path is cached, the user can explore all repositories under /cvmfs. When running analyses, the reference file need only be pointed to the appropriate directory path.

At Pawsey Supercomputing Centre, at present, users on the [Nimbus cloud service](https://pawsey.org.au/systems/nimbus-cloud-service/) can access the Galaxy Project's CernVM-FS data repository webserver /cvmfs/data.galaxyproject.org.

## Setting up CernVM-FS access on Nimbus instances

Setting up CernVM-FS access on Nimbus instances is simple and quick. It requires only running three lines of code:

    git clone https://github.com/qcif/cvmfs-setup-galaxy.git
    cd cvmfs-setup-galaxy/
    sudo ./cvmfs-galaxy-client-setup.sh cvmfs-cachingproxy.pawsey.org.au
